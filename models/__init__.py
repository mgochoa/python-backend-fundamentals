"""
Models Package

This package contains the data models for each topic area:
- library.py: Complete reference implementation (Library System)
- todo.py: Guided implementation with TODOs (Todo System)
- inventory.py: Challenge implementation (Inventory System)

Students will learn about:
- Organizing business logic in model classes
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Interacting with the database from Python code
- Data validation and error handling

Each model file demonstrates a different level of scaffolding:
1. library.py: Full implementation to study and learn from
2. todo.py: Partial implementation with clear TODOs to complete
3. inventory.py: Function signatures only - design and implement yourself
